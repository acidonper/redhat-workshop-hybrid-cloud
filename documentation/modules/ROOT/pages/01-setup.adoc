[#01-laboratory]
== Laboratory

Tutorial's laboratory is basically based on the following technologies:

- Red Hat Openshift Container Platform Cluster
- Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces
- Red Hat Quay
- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management

The previous technologies and resources will allow you to deploy and operate a microservice-based application in a set of Openshift Clusters. The main objective of deploying and operating this application in Openshift using the previous technologies is to understand how Hybrid Cloud and GitOps strategies work together in a Kubernetes environment in order to speed up application management processes.
