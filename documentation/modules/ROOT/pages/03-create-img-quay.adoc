= Create NodeJS Application Container Image in Quay

In this section, you will create a new NodeJS application container image in Red Hat Quay images repository which exposes a set of public images. These images can be used from different Openshift cluster around the world and support you in your multi cluster application deployment.

During this section, you will cover the following general steps:

- Access Red Hat Quay
- Create a Quay User
- Create a public repository
- Build and push a new container image with NodeJS Application inside

_Red Hat Quay_ is a secure, private container registry that builds, analyzes and distributes container images. It provides a high level of automation and customization. Red Hat Quay is also available as a hosted service called Quay.io.

Once your new container image repository is created and published, it is time to build and push the image content to this new repository. 

In order to perform this new task, please follow the next steps:

- Go to the Openshift Console, <ocp_cluster_console> (_E.g. https://console-openshift-console.apps.hybridworkshop.sandbox507.opentlc.com_)

.Openshift Console

- Introduce the following data

  Secret Name: "quay-creds"
  Registry Server Name: "<quay_console_url>"
  Username: "<quay_username>"
  Password: "<quay_pass>"
