= Deploy NodeJS Application in Multiple Openshift Clusters

In this section, you will deploy your NodeJS application in a set of Openshift Clusters using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management as single administration point.

During this section, you will cover the following general steps:

- Access Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management 
- Create an automation procedure based in Helm
- Create an application based on your Helm automatism and the NodeJS repository

Just as information, _Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management_ for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with built-in security policies. Extend the value of Red Hat OpenShift by deploying apps, managing multiple clusters, and enforcing policies across multiple clusters at scale.

== Access Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management Console

First of all, it is required to access _Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management_ console in order to be able to deploy Kubernetes objects in multiple Openshift clusters at the same time. 

- Go to <acm_console_url> (_E.g. https://multicloud-console.apps.hybridworkshop.sandbox507.opentlc.com_)

== Deploy NodeJS App via Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management

Once a user has access to the _Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management_ console and a specific namespace to create Kubernetes objects, it is time to create a set of objects in the respective Openshift clusters in order to run the NodeJS new application in a multicluster way.

Please, follow the next steps to complete the previous objective:

- Create a set of _Deployments_ in the Openshift available clusters replacing the following data

  metadata.namespace: <user_namespace>
  spec.template.spec.containers[0].image: <your_nodejs_app_quay_repo>

[.lines_7]

== Test NodeJS App deployed via Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management

Once the required objects have been created in the _Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management_ console, it is required to ensure the new application is running in the respective Openshift Cluster. During this section, you will be able to review NodeJS app status in a set of Openshift Clusters.

First of all, _Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management_ provides a set of dashboards and overviews in order to allow users to view and check Kubernetes objects status in multiple clusters from a single point of administration. You are able to view at least the following information from these dashboards:

- Openshift Clusters configuration and state
- Openshift Clusters objects providing a search tool
- _Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management_ Apps deployed by Helm or different automated processes
- Governance state of your clusters
- Etc

Please, follow the next steps to find information about kubernetes objects created before and try NodeJS application access:

- Go to Home -> Observe Environments -> Overview

.Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management Home

- Review the search tool accessing to kubernetes objects summary and click on _Route_ objects (_You have to repeat this operation per each Openshift Cluster_)

- Review the route object in order to obtain the url

.Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management Route Summary

- Finally, access to the route url via Web Browser
